  a. compilation-phase
  
  
   -->  for every model property in scope(s) ,
        angular will register 'watchers' functions which are read/write model when it becomes dirty.
     
   -->  all watchers are executed by 'digest-loop' provided by F.W. 
   
   -->  we can also resister  custom watchers also for model properties.
